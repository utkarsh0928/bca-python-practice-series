# 🐍 140+ Daily Python Challenge

Welcome to my Python practice repository! [cite_start]This project is a dedicated journey to master the fundamentals of Python by solving over **140+ basic programs**. 

## 🚀 The Philosophy
> [cite_start]"Start with one program a day and watch your Python skills grow faster than you imagined!" 

This repository serves as a daily log of my progress. Each script is designed to be **time and space efficient**, focusing on clean logic and fundamental problem-solving.

## 📂 Project Overview
The programs in this collection cover a wide range of essential Python topics:
* [cite_start]**Fundamental Math:** Arithmetic operations, area calculations, and solving quadratic equations[cite: 13, 31, 110].
* [cite_start]**Unit Conversions:** Kilometers to miles and Celsius to Fahrenheit[cite: 65, 80].
* [cite_start]**Mathematical Logic:** Prime numbers, Fibonacci sequences, Armstrong numbers, and Disarium numbers[cite: 250, 362, 418, 1375].
* [cite_start]**Data Structures:** CRUD-style operations on lists, arrays, and dictionaries[cite: 947, 1618, 2019].
* [cite_start]**Algorithms:** Recursion, Binary Search, and string manipulation[cite: 768, 812, 2571].
